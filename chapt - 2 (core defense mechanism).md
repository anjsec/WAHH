The fundamental security problem with web applications — that all user input
is untrusted — gives rise to a number of security mechanisms that applications
use to defend themselves against attack.

The defense mechanisms employed by web applications comprise the following
core elements:
* Handling user access to the application’s data and functionality to prevent
users from gaining unauthorized access
* Handling user input to the application’s functions to prevent malformed
input from causing undesirable behavior
* Handling attackers to ensure that the application behaves appropriately
when being directly targeted, taking suitable defensive and offensive
measures to frustrate the attacker
* Managing the application itself by enabling administrators to monitor its
activities and confi gure its functionality

Because of their central role in addressing the core security problem, these
mechanisms also make up the vast majority of a typical application’s attack
surface.
If knowing your enemy is the fi rst rule of warfare, then understanding
these mechanisms thoroughly is the main prerequisite for being able to attacapplications effectively.
